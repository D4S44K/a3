				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first peak in the data was in July 2020 with about 75,000 new Covid-19 cases, followed by a significantly larger 
					(and the largest recorded peak before 2022) between December 2020 and January 2021 with around 250,000 new Covid cases.
				</li>
				<li>There is a sharp drop between June and July 2021, before the cases rise again in August and September 2021, this time 
					with around 200,000 new cases. The cases remained steady until the end of December 2021, at which point they 
					exponentially increased into the beginning of 2022 (with around 350,000 cases).</li>
				<li>It is interesting to note that the peaks are highest during the winter holidays (November with Thanksgiving, December 
					and January with Christmas and New Year's) and potentially at the start of a new school year in September or October 
					(though perhaps this was just because of a new variant spreading, since June and July, which are typically summer 
					vacation months for school-aged children reported record low cases).</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				I really like the creator's decision to make the diagram cyclical and clock-like with the twelve months taking the place of 
				the twelve hours on a clock. This seems particularly relevant in the context of the article, since Covid ebbed and flowed in
				 waves, but remained ever-present, which is symbolized by the circular path of the visualization, the continuity of the 
				 ribbon depicting the number of cases, and the arrow emerging from the January 2022 end. However, I think the circular and 
				 original nature of the figure makes it a little tricky to understand on first glance. Generally, English is read left to 
				 right and top to bottom, which mean that the first time I looked at this visualization, I started at the January 2022 end 
				 of it, instead of the January 2020 end (which is below and to the right of the former). Of course, the visualization cannot 
				 be flipped because Covid cases were only expected to rise (as discussed in both the Opinion article, and highlighted with 
				 the arrow and the exponential increase at the start of January 2022), which means that the creators would run out of space 
				 on the page, and also lose the feel of expansion from the outward moving spiral, which feels more thematically relevant to 
				 the article. In a similar vein, I noticed that the visualization actually starts in January 2020, instead of November 2019, 
				 which is when the first Covid case had been identified. This might be because the year “2020” is more often associated with 
				 the pandemic, despite “19” being in its name, and hence might be a way to make the visualization more accessible to the 
				 audience. With regards to accessibility, I think that including the year and the direction of the movement during the month 
				 of January makes the visualization significantly easier to follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also liked the use of thickness of the red ribbon to indicate the number of Covid cases, but I do think that even with a 
				legend, it is a little difficult to pinpoint a rough estimate of a specific data point without pulling out a ruler. The 
				ribbon works well for rough relative comparisons (greater than, less than, about the same as) between different months and 
				years, but it doesn’t make it easy to make it put a number on the differences either (is it double than? Half of?), especially
				 because the visualization is cyclical and does not have non-contiguous months side-by-side. I think in this case, adding 
				 numbers, especially on peaks and troughs would be helpful and would not interfere with the thematic objective of the 
				 visualization (perhaps only add to it).

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I just wanted to use the same form of visualization as the original and incorporate as many of my 
					critiques as I could. As such, I started the visualization from November 2019 instead of 2020 (but still only labeled 
					2020, since that is the year that is associated with the pandemic in popular culture) and placed a red dot on the first 
					data point to draw the viewer's eyes to the correct end of the graph.</li>
				<li>Next, I marked peak and trough points and (an estimate of) the corresponding number of cases to make the different parts 
					of the visualization easier to compare with the help of the legend and provide a more concrete idea of the scale of the 
					pandemic. All of the measurements and the corresponding text were written in red to support the color scheme frequently 
					associated with visualizations related to Covid-19.</li>
				<li>Finally, I added a space to include rationales for important points (for instance, was a new variant spreading which 
					caused cases to rise? Was there a mask mandate that lowered the number of cases), since the article expresses concern 
					over the likelihood of cases to grow in January 2022 because of the rise of the Omicron variant.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I wanted to deviate a bit from the original form, while still preserving the continuous and ever-present 
					effects. One of the initial critiques I had regarding the NYT design was the lack of direction of where to start looking 
					at the visualization, since it was circular. As such, I decided to "unroll" the initial ribbon and present a clear 
					top-left starting point. </li>
				<li>In order to keep the feeling of the pandemic persevering, I chose to continue with the initial cyclical concept, but 
					instead, portray it through the bends in the ribbon every six months. Two bends corresponded to a year, so even though 
					the sample was just two years, having double the bends made the period seem longer. (Perhaps in the future, I could draw 
					this with an even shorter period and add more bends to further this effect).</li>
				<li>The reduction of curves (besides the bends) was also intended to line up different parts of the visualization for easier
					 comparison. For instance, the thickness of the ribbon during January 2020 can be compared with that during October 2020,
					  which is directly below it and in the same orientation. In addition, the legend includes three different lengths to 
					  create different reference points and make estimating the number of cases easier. Finally, because of the complex
					  movement of the image, I included arrows throughout the ribbon to make it easier for the user to follow along. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this design, I tried to deviate further from the ribbon aesthetic, but still challenge myself to reproduce the 
					recurring themes from the other sketches. The original sketch featured a red color scheme that was frequently associated 
					with visualizations released during and about the Covid-19 pandemic, so I decided to: first, maintain the color scheme by 
					using all red, and second, further be inspired by the plots mapping case count by region, which frequently marked each 
					geographical area with a red circle correlated with the number of cases reported.</li>
				<li>I decided to forgo focusing on the theme of permanence surrounding the pandemic in the interest of exploring a different
					form of visualization, but perhaps the way that the January 2022 circle is cut off by the x-axis grid-line still maintains
					an illusion of incompletion. However, I did consider the continuous nature of the original NYT visualization when playing
					around with the sizes of the circles, fiddling with them to maximize overlap while trying to avoid obscuring smaller
					datapoints. As a viewer can witness by examining the last few datapoints, I wasn't entirely successful, since the
					January 2022 circle entirely conceals the December 2021 circle (though because of the transparency of the circles, both
					are identifiable).</li>
				<li>Because of the unconventional representation of the number of Covid cases, I decided to add grid lines and labels along
					the y-axis corresponding to the radii of significant circles, so that viewers could more tangibly compare the peaks and 
					troughs. I also added an additional label documenting the year below the months to make the presence of so many datapoints
					less overwhelming. This is also one of the reasons that I decided to document one quantity per month instead of continuously
					doing so.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        This final visualization builds upon my last sketch, which drew inspiration from case-count maps and proportional symbols that were
		frequently used throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. In this iteration, I decided to use the new cases count data for every day from 
		January 2020 to January 2022, as noted by the open-source csv file we were given in this assignment. (I decided to remove the extra 
		two months of data following January 2022 that was in the csv file because it was out of the scope of the NYT visualization we are 
		studying).  </p>
		<p>
		There were three main reasons that I decided to use each day's data, rather than calculating one data point corresponding to the month. First, that it
		simultaneously captures the uncertainty of the pandemic on each day as it felt while we lived it (which we somewhat get a feel for 
		by examining the original visualization around January 2021 and January 2022), while also creating a certainty in the overall trends--
		the data conforms to a particular shape with very few outliers. In addition, I wanted to once again focus on the theme of continuity,
		so by using more data points, the overlap between individual circles naturally connects different parts of the visualization together.
		I decided to forgo filling the individual circles so that the relationship between these individual data points would be more easily
		visible, as well as the integrity of the certainty of over 700 data points--the overlapping circumferences practically cover the
		main form by themselves. Finally, I could not decide what singular data point would be sufficient to depict the trends of the month.
		If we use an average or a median, we lose the uncertainty and variation between individual days; using a minimum or a maximum does not
		capture the full scope of the data, and mixing and matching the two across months would lead to an inconsistent picture. It also did
		not hurt that for this last visualization, I had access to my computer, which can graph many more data points than I ever could by hand.
      </p>
	  <p>Further, January 2022 ended up being the most varied of the months in the time scale, which helped emphasize the Opinion article's 
		uncertainty about what the month would bring from the first few data points. In order to further highlight it, I used a lighter red than
		what I used in the rest of the visualization.</p>
		<p>Finally, to provide some concrete measurements of the peaks and troughs (besides what is visible), I provided the hightest or lowest
			Covid-count days in those regions. I decided not to include any other labels besides those statistically significant regions to
			avoid overwhelming data-cautious readers. 
	  </p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Overall, I feel that this final visualization was able to portray the continuity and uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as
		 its ebbs and flows in a similarly effective way to the original NYT visualization. I hope that I was able to improve on the legibility
		 and accessibility of the original design by labeling relevant data points, having a left-to-right reference frame, and a more slightly
		 more common visualization form. However, in doing so, I lost the thematic passing of time that a clock-like aesthetic presented, and
		 in using more data points, some of this final visualization ended up gargled. For instance, the smallest circle depicted in the latter
		 half of the time period corresponds to 2,944 positive Covid tests, however the relative size of the surrounding circles is not much
		 different from the nearby peaks. This is because the smallest data points were hidden by their larger neighbors due to the circular
		 nature of the proportional symbols. Further, because of the size of the January 2022 symbols, the x-axis stretched to April 2022 to
		 accommodate the largest days, which can be a bit confusing since every other part of the graph implies that only the January 2020 to
		 January 2022 time period is being observed. As such, despite my best attempts, it was impossible for me to address all of my own 
		 critiques in an effort to create a "perfect" visualization.
