				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The first peak in the data was in July 2020 with about 75,000 new Covid-19 cases, followed by a significantly larger (and the largest recorded peak before 2022) between December 2020 and January 2021 with around 250,000 new Covid cases.
				</li>
				<li>There is a sharp drop between June and July 2021, before the cases rise again in August and September 2021, this time with around 200,000 new cases. The cases remained steady until the end of December 2021, at which point they exponentially increased into the beginning of 2022 (with around 350,000 cases).</li>
				<li>It is interesting to note that the peaks are highest during the winter holidays (November with Thanksgiving, December and January with Christmas and New Year's) and potentially at the start of a new school year in September or October (though perhaps this was just because of a new variant spreading, since June and July, which are typically summer vacation months for school-aged children reported record low cases).</li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				I really like the creator's decision to make the diagram cyclical and clock-like with the twelve months taking the place of the twelve hours on a clock. This seems particularly relevant in the context of the article, since Covid ebbed and flowed in waves, but remained ever-present, which is symbolized by the circular path of the visualization, the continuity of the ribbon depicting the number of cases, and the arrow emerging from the January 2022 end. However, I think the circular and original nature of the figure makes it a little tricky to understand on first glance. Generally, English is read left to right and top to bottom, which mean that the first time I looked at this visualization, I started at the January 2022 end of it, instead of the January 2020 end. Of course, the visualization cannot be flipped because Covid cases were only expected to rise (as discussed in both the Opinion article, and highlighted with the arrow and the exponential increase at the start of January 2022), which means that the creators would run out of space on the page, and also lose the feel of expansion from the outward moving spiral, which feels more thematically relevant to the article. In a similar vein, I noticed that the visualization actually starts in January 2020, instead of November 2019, which is when the first Covid case had been identified. This might be because the year “2020” is more often associated with the pandemic, despite “19” being in its name, and hence might be a way to make the visualization more accessible to the audience. With regards to accessibility, I think that including the year and the direction of the movement during the month of January makes the visualization significantly easier to follow.

				I also liked the use of thickness of the red ribbon to indicate the number of Covid cases, but I do think that even with a legend, it is a little difficult to pinpoint a rough estimate of a specific data point without pulling out a ruler. The ribbon works well for rough relative comparisons (greater than, less than, about the same as) between different months and years, but it doesn’t make it easy to make it put a number on the differences either (is it double than? Half of?), especially because the visualization is cyclical and does not have non-contiguous months side-by-side. I think in this case, adding numbers, especially on peaks and troughs would be helpful and would not interfere with the thematic objective (perhaps only add to it) of the visualization.
